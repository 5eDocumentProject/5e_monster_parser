# 5e Monster Parser

This is a template repository that contains python scripts for turning YAML files into 5th-edition Dungeons & Dragons monster stat blocks in LaTeX format.

I created a tool for turning strings into LaTeX that I call Brand. That project can be found [here](https://github.com/the-alex-g/brand)
